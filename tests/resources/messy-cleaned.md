After making our layout wireframes, we brainstormed some various thematic ideas.  We mostly thought of items that'd be on a farm.  Some of the ideas that were popular were: wood grain, hanging signs, the historical sign, barn, sun, etchings, grass, farm animals, silo, straw hat, pitch fork, seasonal changes, red, brown, and trees.  It was a brainstorm, so there were many other ideas, although some were less applicable.

In class, we each drew up one or a few quick thematic wireframes.  We didn't have much time, so many weren't fleshed out.  I drew three:

[![Image 1](/image1.jpg "Image 1")](/image1.jpg) These two were based mainly on the historic mark sign that the farm has.  The first had many little signs for top buttons and logo, two big signs for a sidebar and main content area, and then a grassy ground below that serves as a footer.  The page background would be a blue sky.  I felt this might be a little overboard with the signs, but liked the grassy footer and blue sky a lot, using them in most of my designs.  The next drawing kept the footer and had one sign as a sidebar with the logo and accordion navigation.  I included the wagon wheel that is at the base of the Stearn's sign.  I felt a light red barn side or white slatted house side would work for the main content area.

[![Image 2](/image2.jpg "Image 2")](/image2.jpg) My other drawing used faded wood signs for everything.  I wanted an etching on the top banner for the logo and a burn in look for the banner text.  The main content and side bar would be place on parchment nailed to a giant sign.  All of the signs are hanging and hang from each other.

We were then given a couple days to create some more.

[![Image 3](/image3.jpg "Image 3")](/image3.jpg) This one would have barn red as the body background with an open barn door holding the main content.  I wasn't sure how to handle the content, so I figured a fairly normal div box set would work if I couldn't think of anything else.  The top banner would be a wood sign over the door with an etching of the farm, burn in title, and silhouettes of animals with white lettering for the main navigation.  I continued with the grass footer.

[![Image 4](/image4.jpg "Image 4")](/image4.jpg) Next up I made the back of a red barn.  The roof would hold the title (probably no room for a logo) and the main navigation in white paint-like lettering.  The sub navigation would be in a side bar with the same lettering.  The main content would be on a big off white type cloth nailed to the barn.  The footer would again be the grass.  A sun was featured over the roof to add a little brightness.

[![Image 5](/image5.jpg "Image 5")](/image5.jpg) Finally, I came up with a variant of the barn door idea with something inside.  A farmer would be standing with a pitch fork forking a large, squarish pile of hay.  The hay would hold the main content and the farmer would have the accordion side navigation on his back/side.  This version of the door had a cloth banner nailed across the inside top of the door with just the logo and title.  This one seemed very kiddy to me though, would probably only appeal to kids.

``` html
<!doctype html>
<script>alert('hello');</script>
<div>Hello world &amp; universe</div>
```

Paragraph after pre-code block.

``` js
alert('code block without line break before');
```

Paragraph with inline code markdown `<div>hello &amp; goodbye</div>` to test.  I must also say &c.

Paragraph with inline code tag `<div>hello &amp; goodbye</div>` to test.  I must also say &c.
